# Data-Visualization

As part of the Master's program in Data Science and Engineering, together with two colleagues, we carried out data visualization projects that involved creating dashboards to share insights from large datasets. The projects included data collection and processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), prototyping, and the development of visualizations.
